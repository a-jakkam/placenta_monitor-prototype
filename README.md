# Placenta Monitor Prototype

## Project Overview
This project is a prototype design for a non-invasive wearable device that tracks placental blood flow using Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS). It includes mockups, diagrams, and design notes.

## Folder Structure
- `mockups/` – Figma screens and app interface designs
- `diagrams/` – CAD, DCS component diagrams, and optical paths
- `docs/` – Design requirements, baseline config, and component list
- `figs/` – Additional illustrations

## How to Use
- View the mockups and diagrams for design reference
- Read the `.md` files in `docs/` for design notes
- This repository is for documentation and design prototyping; it does not include functional code.
